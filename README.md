### hello,

my name is Dylan and I'm currently an undergrad computer science student. I have some experience with backend development in school and work. I'm pursuing a BS Computer Science / MS Artificial Intelligence degree at my university. Some of my completed projects are listed below:

- e cinema booking system: web app for cinema companies to manage their showings, users, admins, payments, etc. 
- goodgreek: web app built for greek orgs to post philanthropy events for users to see and interact with.
- cfb javafx app: I like college football so I created an app that displays player bio, statistics, and images.
- dylancrter.github.io: basic portfolio site linked under my pfp.

I'm also currently working on:

- deditor: my own text editor I'm implementing in C. The goal is for it to be as light-weight as possible.
- langtex: a llm wrapper for converting natural language to latex.
- from the tensor: a 9-week ML course where I'll be learning the basics of ml and implementing papers.

feel free to email me at dylanc.rter@gmail.com or contact me through the links on my portfolio site!
