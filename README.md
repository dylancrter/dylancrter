#Hello,

I'm Dylan and I'm currently an undergrad computer science student. I have some experience with backend development in school and work. I am a part of the AI Double Dawgs program at the University of Georgia and am set to graduate in the Spring of 2025. Some of my more prominent projects are listed below:

- E Cinema Booking System: Created a comprehensive booking software for cinema companies. Worked primarily on backend with Java + SpringBoot and MySQL for the database.
- GoodGreek: Hacked up a pretty basic philanthropy platform for UGA Greek Life Organizations at UGAHacks9. Same tech stack as E Cinema.
- CFB JavaFX App: Used JavaFX, the CFB API, and Bing Search API to create a comprehensive College Football App.
- Personal Portfolio Site: Listed under my pfp, pretty basic but functional
